 Analyzes the top 30 books on Amazon

This script was began on July 1st 2022 for a data science class,
and I only got acess to the code on the 5th, meaning I missed the
week of July 1st in this data. The data was collected by using the
wayback machine on archive.org. The title of the weeks are a bit
confusing, since 4/29/22 is marked as week ten, since it was the
last data point that I collected, and 7/5/22 is marked as week one,
since it was the first data point that I collected.

When the program runs, the first plot will show, and the second
plot will be shown after you close the first.
